# Codepunk ðŸ§ ðŸ’»

**Codepunk** is my personal repository for tracking progress as I learn frontend development â€” primarily through platforms like [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/) and [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

This repo includes subprojects and experiments that helped me practice key React and JavaScript concepts, along with my commit history to document the journey.

## ðŸš€ What's Inside

This repo contains subfolders, each focused on a specific project or skill area:

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `assembly-endgame/` | A mini-game built with React to practice state, props, and game logic. Code is hidden to respect course policies. |
| `tenzies/`          | A dice game implemented in React with confetti animation. Code hidden, but commit history preserved. |
| `...`               | Additional projects will be added as I continue learning.

## ðŸ§± Technologies Practiced

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6+)
- React (components, state, props, conditional rendering)
- Git & GitHub (branching, commit tracking, .gitignore, subtree)
- Responsive design & layout techniques

## ðŸ§  Why This Exists

- To document and reflect on what I'm learning
- To demonstrate consistent effort and growth
- To build habits around Git, code organization, and documentation

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

Some projects do not include full code due to licensing restrictions from paid learning platforms. In these cases, only commit history and a `README.md` are provided.
